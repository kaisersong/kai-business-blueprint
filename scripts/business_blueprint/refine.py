"""Refine command: AI generates a structured diff from user feedback.

This module is LLM-agnostic. The caller supplies a ``llm_call(prompt) -> str``
function. We provide:

- ``build_refine_prompt`` — assembles the prompt sent to the LLM
- ``parse_refine_response`` — robustly extracts the JSON diff from LLM output
- ``refine_blueprint`` — top-level orchestration: prompt → parse → apply → write

For the in-skill default, ``stdout_llm_caller`` writes the prompt to a file and
expects the caller to paste the LLM response back. This keeps the module usable
without binding to a specific API.

EXISTING BLUEPRINT (JSON):
```json
{blueprint_json}
```

USER FEEDBACK:
{feedback}

PRIOR CLARIFICATIONS (from earlier turn, may be empty):
{clarifications}

OUTPUT a refine diff as JSON with EXACTLY this structure:

```json
{{
  "diffId": "diff-{timestamp}",
  "baseBlueprintRevisionId": "{base_revision}",
  "operations": [
    {{"op": "modify", "path": "library.knowledge.painPoints[0].name", "old": "...", "new": "..."}},
    {{"op": "add", "path": "library.knowledge.painPoints[]", "value": {{...full entity dict...}}}},
    {{"op": "delete", "path": "library.knowledge.pitfalls[2]"}}
  ],
  "rationale": "1-2 sentences explaining how these changes address the feedback"
}}
```

CONSTRAINTS:
- Each operation must be MINIMAL and FOCUSED. Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- Modifications preserve entity IDs (only change name/fields, never the id).
- Additions must include id (fresh sequential), name, entityType.
- Deletions remove the entire entity. Also delete relations referencing the deleted ID
  (emit additional delete operations for those relations).
- For new knowledge entities, run self-check (see references/knowledge-self-check.md)
  and populate ``_selfCheck`` with passed/questions arrays.
- Path syntax:
  - Use ``library.knowledge.painPoints[0].name`` for modify of a specific field.
  - Use ``library.knowledge.painPoints[]`` (empty brackets) to APPEND.
  - Use ``library.knowledge.pitfalls[2]`` (with index) to DELETE the third pitfall.
- Output ONLY the JSON diff, no commentary, no markdown fencing other than the
  triple-backtick block above (the parser handles either).
